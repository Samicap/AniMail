# AniMail

Connect with other kids all over the world using our slow messaging pen pal app!

# What makes us different?
We are unique in that we let our users choose from different animals to carry their mail to their pen pal friends!  Different animals fly, swim, or run at different speeds!  Kids receiving their mail can watch how long till it arrives in their mailbox!
